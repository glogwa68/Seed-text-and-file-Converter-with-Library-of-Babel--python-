Hello @everyone!

I present to you the new data directory project created from completion from the Library of Babel.


For install the program started not install the "requirements.txt" file with the command 
"pip install -r requirements.txt".

then you can run the project by launching the "convert_to_seed.py" file and it will 
offer you to enter 1 or 2 if you enter 1 you transform the text into a key (seed) 
and if you enter 2 you transform a file into a "seed" key part 2 is still being 
created so not fully functional.

to have the basic text from the seed you can execute the file named "convert_to_file.py" 
then indicating the .seed file contained in the seed folder, of the seed you want to translate.
